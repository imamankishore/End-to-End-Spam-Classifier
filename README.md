# 📧 Spam Classifier – End-to-End NLP Project  

This project is an **End-to-End Spam Classifier** that predicts whether a given message is *Spam* or *Ham (Not Spam)*.  
It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning algorithms**, with deployment on **localhost** for interactive usage.

## 🚀 Features  
- Text preprocessing (stopwords removal, stemming, tokenization)  
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF / Bag of Words**  
- Machine Learning model training & evaluation  
- Interactive web app (Flask / Streamlit) running on localhost  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python 🐍  
- NLTK / Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Streamlit (for deployment)  

---

## 📂 Project Workflow  
1. Data Preprocessing (Cleaning, Tokenization, Stemming)  
2. Feature Extraction (TF-IDF Vectorizer)  
3. Model Building (Naive Bayes)  
4. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1)  
5. Localhost Deployment (Web app for user input)

## 📸 Demo  
- Input: `"You won a free lottery ticket, claim now!"`  
- Output: **Spam** ✅  

- Input: `"Hey, are we still meeting tomorrow?"`  
- Output: **Not Spam (Ham)** ✅
